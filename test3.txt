this file test3.txt is created by gopal61288 (not owner... someone who forked the original repository... owner is gopal-sakshi)
lets see how this reflects in gopal-sakshi/Learnings.git

Now, I am adding stuff from gopal-sakshi account...
lets see what happens when I (git pull upstream master)

adding some more stuff in test3.txt (From gopal-sakshi)
earlier stuff_added in 4,5 lines (some how got reflected in gopal61288) (dont know how)
I only did git (pull upstream main) in VS code local repository... 
it should mean, that new_changes_and_updates shold only be there in VS code local repository
how come, they got reflected in github gopal61288 (remote origin repository) ??
